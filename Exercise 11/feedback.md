# Final Score 19/20

In your version of Random Forest, you chose to limit the number of features selected as the square root of the number of features. Since we have 11 features, that gives us 3 in each tree. Do you think that was a good choice? Did you have any justification for those values?

You had a great explanation and comparison at the end.  I really like how you put the charts side by side, but when you do that, make sure the y-axis has the same range and scale. As drawn, it feels like XGBoost performs much worse than Random Forest, which is not the case.
