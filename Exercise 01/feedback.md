## Score: 20/20

### Part 1
Just some quick notes on the code.
* Most Python style guides suggest using `snake_case` for variables rather than `CamelCase` but that's just FYI.
* I like how you split the `count_vals()` and `bucketit()` into separate functions. That helps readability.
* Rounding is probably going to be problematic for a general solution, but fine here with 10 buckets.
* Great to have lots of comments, but you probably don't need every line of code commented unless that's helpful for you.

### Part 2
* Great observations on what chatGPT was able to do more efficiently and more completely than your code. It's good to think about _why_ it is that you didn't include some of those in your code. Time? Didn't think about them? They weren't part of the instructions? Something about Python you didn't know?
* I like your stream of consciousness thinking about the pros and cons, and thinking about them from different perspectives. These are hard questions to answer.
