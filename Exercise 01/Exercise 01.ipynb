It was A LOT quicker than me, though!\n    b.\tAre there any parts of the AI-generated code you were unfamiliar with?\n        YES, I had to refamiliarize myself with the looping in the sum builtin (or I didn't recall it from my Python training).\n    c.\tWhat are some major differences between your code and the AI-generated code?\n        1. I didn't account for an empty list in my function, that's good coding practice.  Also, I \"brute-force\" counted the number in each range with a separate function for each value.  As mentioned, I was not aware (or forgot) about the sum builtin with internal looping capability.  So, I had to traverse the entire list each time to do the count with a separate function.  It worked, but might not have been as efficient.\n"

I didn't.  In fact, I mistakenly used a Python builtin for a variable name and it took me an hour to figure out how to restart the snowflake python kernel.  The code looked right, but it wouldn't execute without errors.  Once I renamed some variables and restarted the kernel, it worked.  I had vaguely remembered this same error happening to me, but with Jupyter Notebooks.  That's why in my prompt I mentioned to ChatGPT this is snowflake Python.  My first impression is that it can be great at generating code.  The comments were not as thorough (in my view), the code was more efficient (but not as readable as mine), and it turns out I learned something I didn't know (or forgot) by the code it generated.\n    b.\tWhat are the benefits of doing so?\n        I think the generated code will be much more efficient than I will be at this stage of my Python career.  I'll learn a lot from how ChatGPT generates the code.\n    c.\tWhat are the risks and challenges (both near term and in the long run) with using AI for this course?\n        I learned a lot attempting to code it myself and I also learned a lot from the ChatGPT code.  This was an interesting exercise and I learned something different from both approaches.  The risk in not using it is that there are approaches I can learn from it, that I wouldn't have otherwise thought of.  I suppose, over time, as I become more proficient, that will happen less often.  So, in the long run the risk should subside.  Also, I think my code was much more readable and I always think that's important.  Then again, the ChatGPT code was probably much more efficient.  It would be interesting to run timing tests on both of these approaches to see which one came most quickly to the answer.  Ironically, I'd have to query Google or ChatGPT to remind me of how to capture the timestamps!  For small projects like this, I don't see much risk in using it - provided all code is carefully inspected and documented (by the human).  For bigger projects (in the long run), I'd be concerned the human would simply \"accept\" large parts of code without inspecting every line of it.  This is contradictory.  If I was leading a development team on a large project, on one hand I'd want the time efficiency that comes from code generation.  On the other hand I'd want to know my software engineers inspected every line of code.  I suppose I'd insist on even more thorough testing.  This is all new to me and so much to learn.  I'll be interested in what you think, as well as the others.\n"
