# Score: 19/20

You make a really good point about clarifying the goal: understand sales and potentially plan / sell more... or win the bet!!

In your notebook, you've got all the code packaged into a single cell. As I'm sure you've seen by now, we don't have to put all the code for a single question in one cell. With notebooks, the unit of "running code" is at the cell level. So, if you want to be able to easily change your visualization code without rerunning a correlation, you should be that code in a separate cell. As your code is written, any time you hit run, you end up doing everything again: read data, do plots, run correlation, do plats, build model, etc. (-1)

Generally, if we're talking about simple linear regression, the rule of thum bis R^2 > 0.88 is a solid explanatory model.

Love your final conclusion about the wager!!
