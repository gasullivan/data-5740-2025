Leadership wants to improve customer retention and expansion, but doesn’t know how to prioritize where to focus these improvements or which focus areas will have the biggest impact on future revenue. After a project finishes, some clients sign additional work within 12 months; others don’t. You’ve been asked to predict expected next-12-months revenue from each customer based on project attributes and delivery performance, and to identify which levers most influence retention spend.\nYour deliverable should be in the form of a Snowflake notebook and follow the Steps in Model Building we use in class (included in the rubric below) and demonstrate solid data hygiene, reasoning, and statistical rigor.\n\nData provided\nFile: midterm_construction_projects.csv (650 rows; one row per completed project)\nTarget:\n•\tnext12mo_spend — dollars of revenue expected from the customer in the 12 months after the indexed project.\nPossible Features:\n•\tCustomer: industry, region\n•\tProject: project_type, contract_type, project_size_usd, scope_complexity, close_time_days\n•\tDelivery: n_change_orders, on_time_milestones_pct, safety_incidents, time_overrun_pct, cost_overrun_pct, payment_delay_days, pm_experience_years, discount_pct, is_union_site\n•\tContext: prior_relationship_years, competition_count\n\n \n\nDeliverables & Outline \nUse these section headers in your notebook.\n1.\tIdentify & Clarify the Problem (10 pts)\no\tIn your own words: business objective, decision context, and why prediction + interpretation matter.\n2.\tBackground (10 pts)\no\tBriefly describe factors that could drive retention spend in construction (cite a source if you like).\n3.\tSelect Variables (10 pts)\no\tPropose a starting set of predictors.

   "source": "1.\tIdentify & Clarify the Problem (10 pts)\n    •\tIn your own words: business objective, decision context, and why prediction + interpretation matter.\n\nBusiness Objective: \nThe primary goal is to assist our construction firm leaders in determining the best way possible to increase customer retention and grow our revenue.  Specifically, we need to predict how much revenue a client will generate in the year after a completed project.  To guide management to the most efficient application of our resources, we need to identify the key drivers of the anticipated spend.  We will conduct a data-driven analysis to determine where best to focus our retention and expansion efforts.\n\nDecision Context: \nTo do this we need to understand which sales or operational improvements we should prioritize that, in most likelihood, will result in increased spend with our construction firm.  In other words, what can we do today to maximize long-term revenue with our existing clients.  For example, should we focus on improving on-time delivery? Reducing cost overruns? Investing in more experienced project managers? Each initiative requires investment, and we need to assist leadership in determining how best to prioritize interventions that will maximize future revenue.\n\nWhy Prediction + Interpretation Matter: \nPrediction matters because it helps us to estimate future revenue for each client by improving forecasting and helping us to understand where to prioritize our resources (particularly, our account management resources).\nInterpretation matters as it helps us understand WHY some clients spend more and others do not.  In turn, this takes us a step past simple forecasting and provides insights into operational and/or sales adjustments we can make to achieve our desired outcome.\n"

   "source": "2.\tBackground (10 pts)\n    •\tBriefly describe factors that could drive retention spend in construction (cite a source if you like).\n\nThroughout my career, I have enjoyed many opportunities to work on IT-related matters for construction projects.  I've also been on the Board of two industrial automation companies and on the Board of several entities who have undertaken large construction efforts.  I am very familiar with the construction and maintenance of manufacturing plants and many other heavy industrial projects.  Not the least of which was my direct responsibility in shipbuilding and ship overhauls in drydocks from my time at Carnival Corporation.  So, my thoughts here are my own from those experiences in supporting contractors (general and otherwise) or direct through my various employments and Board positions.\n\nAbove all, I've observed how deeply critical personal relationships are in the industry.  There are, of course, often times certain compliance requirements on contracts (e.g., minority-owned contractor participation threshholds).  Even then, the relationships matter as they form a basis of trust that can only be achieved by having done work together over many years and multiple projects.  So, I start with relationship factors.  Beyond that, many are obvious and I'll explain here:\n\nRelationship Factors: Prior relationship length (and depth) indicates established trust and familiarity with client needs. Longer relationships typically yield higher retention rates due to reduced friction and better understanding of client requirements.\n\nSafety & Quality: Safety incidents and change orders reflect operational excellence and can significantly impact client satisfaction and willingness to engage in future projects. I've always admired how safety-focused these firms are, including some who start every single meeting with a \"safety moment\", where someone is picked to explain a recent situation where safety was considered first and foremost.\n\nDelivery Performance: On-time completion, budget adherence, and quality execution build trust and increase likelihood of repeat business. Research shows that construction clients prioritize  reliability and predictability in project delivery (Construction Industry Institute).  It's always easiest to pick the \"sure thing\" when it comes to confidence in safely meeting delivery timelines. By nature, we become most comfortable through personal experiences and we tend to recognize, remember and appreciate those individuals who ahve safely delivered on-time, within budget.\n\nProject Complexity & Size: Successful delivery of complex, large-scale projects demonstrates capability and can lead to expanded scope with existing clients. However, complexity also increases risk of issues that could damage relationships. It's how those complex situations are handled that matters most - at the human level. Herein lies another opportunity to gain confidence and trust, through successful engagements.\n\nCompetitive Environment: The number of competing bids affects both initial project terms and subsequent retention. Less competition may indicate specialized capability or strong relationships.  Contracting compliance requirements may also influence the competitive environment.\n\nEconomic Terms: Discounting, payment terms, and contract structure signal client value perception and financial health of the relationship. All else equal, price matters. That said, I've seen situations where customers will pay more if they expect better outcomes (safety, quality, timeliness of delivery, meeting compliance requirements, etc.).\n"

Briefly justify any exclusions or transformations.\n\nI started by categorizing the potential variables intended to model our next12mo)spend dollar amount, which represents follow-on business expected from the client in the year following project completion.  Here are my proposed starting predictors and why I selected them:\n\nCustomer-Related (2 variables):\n- industry: Different industries may have varying project frequency and budget patterns\n- region: Geographic factors may influence market dynamics and competitive landscapes\n\nProject Characteristics (5 variables):\n- project_type: NewBuild, Expansion, or Retrofit may signal different retention patterns\n- contract_type: GMP vs FixedBid affects risk allocation and relationship dynamics\n- project_size_usd: Larger projects may correlate with customer capacity for future spend (will log-transform due to right skew)\n- scope_complexity: More complex projects demonstrate capability but increase delivery risk\n- close_time_days: Project duration may indicate relationship depth\n\nDelivery Performance (8 variables):\n- on_time_milestones_pct: Direct measure of delivery reliability\n- cost_overrun_pct: Budget adherence signals project management quality\n- time_overrun_pct: Schedule adherence affects client operations and satisfaction\n- safety_incidents: Safety record impacts reputation and client confidence (will log-transform)\n- n_change_orders: Reflects scope stability and project management (will square root-transform)\n- payment_delay_days: May indicate client financial health or satisfaction (will log-transform)\n- pm_experience_years: More experienced PMs may deliver better outcomes\n- is_union_site: Labor structure may affect costs and delivery patterns\n\nRelationship & Competition (3 variables):\n- prior_relationship_years: Existing relationship strength is likely a key retention driver (will log-transform)\n- competition_count: Competitive intensity at project initiation (will square root-transform)\n- discount_pct: Pricing strategy and client value perception\n\nVariables Excluded:\n- project_id: Identifier with no predictive value\n- customer_satisfaction: While valuable, this appears to be post-project feedback that may not be available at prediction time, and could cause data leakage. I'll check correlation but likely exclude.\n- retained_12mo: This is a binary version of our target variable (next12mo_spend > 0), so it must be excluded to avoid data leakage\n\nPlanned Transformations (first pass was visual inspection of distribution, then I performed skewness tests and transformed based on results):\n- Log-transform project_size_usd due to right skew and a wide range\n- Log-transform and payment_delay_days due to right skew with zeros\n- Log-transform prior_relationship_years due to diminishing returns\n- Log-transform safety_incidents due to many zero values\n- Square root-transform competition_count and n_change_orders due to small count data\n- "

Dollar predictions enable ROI calculations and resource allocation decisions\n- **When useful**: Could be complementary analysis to identify retention drivers separately\n\n**Regularization (Ridge/Lasso)** (I'll run a quick check on this in the main code, and will conduct a more thorough analysis separately at the very end):\n- **Consideration**: Ridge (L2) or Lasso (L1) regression can handle multicollinearity and prevent overfitting\n- **Approach**: I'll check VIF for multicollinearity first. If severe, Ridge may help stabilize estimates\n- **Trade-off**: Regularization sacrifices some interpretability and requires hyperparameter tuning\n- **Plan**: Start with OLS for interpretability; use Ridge/Lasso as bonus sensitivity check if needed\n\n**Tree-Based Methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)**:\n- **Consideration**: Could capture non-linear relationships and interactions automatically\n- **Rejected for primary model**: Black-box nature makes it difficult to extract actionable insights \n  about *which specific levers* to pull\n- **When useful**: Could validate findings from OLS or explore non-linear patterns if residuals show \n  systematic patterns\n\n### Why OLS is Appropriate:\n- Linear relationships are interpretable and actionable for operations teams\n- We can explicitly model interactions if theory suggests them (e.g., complexity × PM experience)\n- Diagnostic tools (residual plots, VIF, influence statistics) help identify violations\n- Coefficient standard errors provide statistical rigor for recommendations\n- Business stakeholders understand \"each unit increase in X leads to $Y change in spend\""

assumption given data structure\n   \n3. **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance of residuals\n   - Will check via residuals vs fitted plot\n   \n4. **Normality**: Residuals are approximately normally distributed\n   - Will assess via Q-Q plot and Shapiro-Wilk test\n   \n5. **No perfect multicollinearity**: Predictors are not perfectly correlated\n   - VIF analysis above addresses this\n   \n6. **No influential outliers**: Individual observations don't drive results\n   - Will check via Cook's distance and leverage statistics\n\"\"\"\n\n#save prepared dataset for modeling\nprint(\"\\n###

   "source": "**WHAT I STARTED WITH (Our Baseline Model)**\n\nI built our first model to predict how much money customers would spend with us in the next 12 months. Here's what went into it:\n\n• **What I'm predicting**: The dollar amount each customer will spend in the next year\n\n• **What I used to make predictions**: 32 different factors about each project (this number grew from 18 original factors because we had to convert categories like \"region\" into numbers)\n\n• **How I prepared the data**: I transformed some variables to make the math work better:\n  - For variables with extreme high values (like project size), I used a mathematical adjustment called \"log transformation\" to bring them to a more normal scale\n  - For counting variables (like number of competitors), I used square root transformation\n  - For categories (like which region or industry), I converted them into yes/no columns the computer can understand\n\n• **How well it worked**: \n  - The model explained about 29% of why customers spend different amounts (that's the R² score)\n  - When I adjust for the number of factors I used, it explained 25% (adjusted R²)\n  - The model as a whole was statistically meaningful (not just random chance)\n\n---\n\n**WHAT I TESTED TO MAKE IT BETTER**\n\n**Test #1: Should I transform the target variable too?**\n• **Result**: No, I kept it as-is\n• **Why**: The spending amounts were already fairly evenly distributed (not too skewed), so changing them would just make interpretation harder without helping the model\n\n**Test #2: Should I remove unusual data points?**\n• **What I found**: 33 projects (about 5% of our data) looked like outliers\n• **Result**: I kept them all\n• **Why**: When I tested removing them, some numbers changed dramatically (up to 239%), but I decided these projects were legitimate and keeping them gave me a more realistic picture. Removing them would mean ignoring real-world situations.\n\n**Test #3: Does project complexity affect retention differently depending on PM experience?**\n• **What I tested**: Maybe experienced project managers handle complex projects better, which could boost retention even more\n• **Result**: Didn't work\n• **Why**: The statistics showed this combination didn't actually help predict retention (p-value was 0.57, meaning 57% chance it's just random). The model didn't get meaningfully better by including this interaction.\n\n---\n\n**In simple terms**: I built a solid starting model, tested a few ways to improve it, but found that our original approach was already pretty good. Sometimes the best model is the straightforward one!"

Think of it like this: when you fit a line through data points, you could draw a wiggly line that touches every point perfectly, or you could draw a smooth line that captures the general trend. Regularization encourages the smooth line.\n\n### The Two Techniques I'm Testing:\n\n**1. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**\n- **What it does**: Shrinks all coefficient estimates toward zero, but never all the way to zero\n- **How it helps**: Stabilizes coefficient estimates when predictors are correlated with each other\n- **Best for**: Improving prediction accuracy and handling multicollinearity\n- **Analogy**: Like turning down the volume on all instruments in an orchestra proportionally\n\n**2. Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)**\n- **What it does**: Can shrink some coefficients all the way to exactly zero, eliminating them\n- **How it helps**: Performs automatic feature selection by identifying which variables truly matter\n- **Best for**: Simplifying the model and identifying the most important predictors\n- **Analogy**: Like muting some instruments entirely to focus on the most important ones\n\n---\n\n## Why This Analysis is Well-Justified\n\n### 1. **Validating OLS Results**\nOur OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) model gave us clear, interpretable results. But is it stable? Regularization provides an independent check:\n- If Ridge and Lasso give similar coefficients to OLS → **High confidence in OLS**\n- If regularization changes conclusions dramatically → **OLS may be overfit**\n\n### 2. **Addressing Multicollinearity Concerns**\nWith 32 predictors (after one-hot encoding), some variables naturally correlate:\n- Geographic regions may correlate with industries\n- Project size may correlate with complexity\n- Ridge regression specifically addresses this by stabilizing estimates\n\n### 3. **Feature Selection Insights**\nWith many potential predictors, Lasso helps answer: \"Which variables REALLY matter?\"\n- Lasso automatically eliminates truly unimportant variables\n- Variables that survive Lasso are robustly important\n- Provides a data-driven way to simplify the model\n\n### 4. **Industry Best Practice**\nModern predictive modeling always includes regularization as a robustness check:\n- Standard practice in data science and machine learning\n- Shows methodological rigor\n- Demonstrates we're not cherry-picking results\n\n---\n\n## What I Learn from This Analysis\n\n### If OLS and Regularization Agree (R² within 1-2%):\n✓ **Strong validation** that OLS coefficients are stable and trustworthy  \n✓ No severe multicollinearity problems  \n✓ High confidence in business recommendations from OLS  \n✓ Regularization confirms rather than contradicts OLS findings  \n\n### If Regularization Differs Significantly:\n⚠ **Caution needed** - OLS estimates may be unstable  \n⚠ Consider using Ridge coefficients for prediction  \n⚠ Use Lasso to identify truly important variables  \n⚠ May need to simplify model or address multicollinearity  \n\n---\n\n## How I Interpret the Results\n\n### Ridge Results:\n- **Low shrinkage (coefficients change <20%)**: OLS is stable ✓\n- **Moderate shrinkage (20-50%)**: Some instability, Ridge provides insurance ⚠\n- **High shrinkage (>50%)**: Significant multicollinearity, prefer Ridge 🚨\n\n### Lasso Results:\n- **Variables kept (coef ≠ 0)**: Robustly important predictors\n- **Variables eliminated (coef = 0)**: Potentially redundant or weak predictors\n- **Consensus variables**: Those important in OLS, Ridge, AND Lasso are the highest confidence\n\n### Performance Comparison:\n- **Similar R²**: Model is stable, OLS is fine\n- **Ridge/Lasso higher R²**: They may predict better on new data\n- **Ridge/Lasso lower R²**: They sacrifice some fit for stability (often worth it)\n\n---\n\n## Business Value of This Analysis\n\n1. **Confidence in Recommendations**: If regularization validates OLS, leadership can act with confidence\n2. **Risk Management**: Identifies if our model is too sensitive to specific data points\n3. **Prioritization**: Lasso tells us which variables to focus on if resources are limited\n4. **Robustness**: Shows our findings hold up under different analytical approaches\n\n---\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n- **Standardization**: Features must be standardized (mean=0, std=1) for fair penalty application\n- **Cross-validation**: I use 5-fold CV to select optimal alpha (regularization strength)\n- **Alpha parameter**: \n  - Alpha = 0 → Pure OLS (no penalty)\n  - Small alpha → Gentle regularization\n  - Large alpha → Heavy shrinkage\n- **Comparison**: I evaluate on the SAME data to assess agreement, not to choose \"best\" model\n\n---\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nRegularization is not about finding a \"better\" model than OLS - it's about **validating** that our OLS results are trustworthy and understanding which findings are most robust. Think of it as a second opinion from a different doctor: if they agree, you're confident in the diagnosis. If they disagree, you dig deeper.\n\nFor CAPS Construction, this analysis will show leadership whether our retention spend recommendations are based on stable, reliable patterns or if there's uncertainty they need to know about."
