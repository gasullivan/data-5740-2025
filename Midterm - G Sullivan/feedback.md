# Midterm: 194/200


1. **Identify & Clarify the Problem (10/10 pts)**
   1. Excellent business clarification
2. **Background (10/10 pts)**
   1. Great work bringing your own personal experience into the story.
3. **Select Variables (10/10 pts)**
   1. Good plan with your variables.
   2. Several times you mentioned doing a log transformation on fields that "have a lot of zeros." Make sure you're clear about exactly what kind of transformation you're going to do.  A "log1p" is needed to accomodate zeros.
4. **Acquire Data (10/10 pts)**
5. **Choose Modeling Approach (20/20 pts)**
6. **Exploratory Data Analysis & Assumptions (20/20 pts)**
7. **Fit the Model (19/20 pts)**
   1. You mention that Pharma and Healthcare are significant "versus reference category"... but what was the reference category? (-1)
8. **Diagnostics (20/20 pts)**
9. **Address Deficiencies (20/20 pts)**
   1. Great explanation of the choices you made and why.
10. **Interpret & Communicate (30/30 pts)**
    1. Excellent explanation of the model and application back to reality.

* **Communication Clarity and Coding Style (20/30 pts)**
  * 1. The notebook would have benefited from more use of markdown to aid in readability. Glad you figured it out part of the way through, though!
  * 2. Generally, you also packed a lot of code into individual cells. It works better if you spread out your code across multiple cells.  You might consider the rule of thumb that each output you want to create probably warrants a separate cell, rather than having a very large cell that prints out many different things.
  * 3. You got into the pattern of having your code print out your comments. I would have been clearer to just put those comments into markdown cells by themselves. They would have been easier to read and you'would have had less code
* ****Bonus (+5):****
