Nice work and great conclusion write-up at the end. It's important, as you've done, to understand the goal of the analysis to help interpret the variables and coefficients in the model.

Are we merely trying to predict CHP so we can understand risks and costs associated with chronic disease; or are we trying to identify which of those levers we can control can have the most impact?

Nice work.


Once you determined that season was not going to be an important factor, you should have removed it from the model so as not to introduce unnecessary bias.
