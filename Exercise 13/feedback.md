# Final Score 19/20

I think you made a mistake somewhere, maybe just in how you wrote up the conclusions at the end.  The ratios beween truthy/non in the two different files weren't exactly inverses.  It should have been:

```
## social ##

label_is_true
0     838
1    1162


## less ##

label_is_true
0    1475
1     525

```

Your notes are otherwise right, thouhg. That the **less** dataset has many fewer **true** posts. It's just more than simply an inverse of the ratio in hte **social** dataset.

Nice work overall and great conclusions.
